# HBase Row Cache
HBase Row cache, powered by [Carrot Cache](https://github.com/carrotdata/carrot-cache)  and updated to HBase 2.x. This cache is impelemented as HBase co-processor and can be easily installed into any HBase cluster.
[Apache HBase](https://hbase.apache.org) is an open-source, distributed, versioned, column-oriented store modeled after Google' Bigtable: A Distributed Storage System for Structured Data by Chang et al [link](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//archive/bigtable-osdi06.pdf). Just as Bigtable leverages the distributed data storage provided by the Google File System, HBase provides Bigtable-like capabilities on top of [Apache Hadoop](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//archive/bigtable-osdi06.pdf). The official HBase still lacks one BigTable feature, namely - Scan Cache, which caches frequently requested key-value pairs. This project adds this functionality to Apache HBase.   

## Where is the BigTable's ScanCache?

* ScanCache in Goggle's BigTable is responsible for caching hot rows data. 
* It improves read performance when read operation is much smaller than block size (blocks are cached in a block cache)
* This feature is still missing in HBase (as of 2.6.1).  
* It's very hard to implement in Java as since it puts extreme pressure on GC (when done on heap).
* GC pauses grow beyond acceptable levels in live enterprise environments due to heap fragmentation. 
* Unpredictability of GC interruption hurts as well.

## ROW-CACHE

* Fast Off Heap ScanCache implementation for HBase (2.x).
* Its much more efficient than block cache when average read operation size is much less than block size because it does not pollute block cache with data that is not needed. 
* Supports in-memory, disk-only and hybrid modes.
* Cache size: 100's of GBs to TBs of RAM/Disk with low predictable query latency.
* Can be used with the following eviction policies (LRU, S-LRU, FIFO). S-LRU is default.
* Pure 100% - compatible Java. The only native code is Zstd compression codecs (Linux x86 and Mac OSX). It can works on any Java platform with compression disabled.
* Sub-millisecond latencies (on network),  zero GC.
* Implemented as RegionObserver co-processor.
* Easy installation and configuration. 

## ROW-CACHE (Details)

* It caches data on read (read through cache). 
* Cache key is table:rowkey:family (table name + row key + column family)
* If row has multiple CFs (column families) - they will be cached separately.
* It caches the whole CF data (all column qualifiers + all versions) even if only part of it was requested.
* Works best when size of CF is < block size. With default block size of 64KB we are talking about kilobytes - not megabytes.
* Cached data is invalidated on every mutation for a particular rowkey:family. Every time, the column family is updated/deleted for a given row key, the corresponding entry gets evicted from the cache. 
* Make sure that your access is read mostly. 
* The ROW-CACHE can be enabled/disabled per table and per table:family (column family).
* The setting is visible in HBase shell and HBase UI. There is new ROW_CACHE attribute on a table and table:column.  
  The table:column settings of ROW_CACHE overwrites table's setting. 
* One can enable both: row cache and block cache on a table, but usually it either first or second needs to be enabled.
* Its very convenient for testing: run test with ROW_CACHE = false, then using provided utility - enable ROW_CACHE and re-run test. 
* Tables which have random (small) read mostly access pattern will benefit most from ROW-CACHE (make sure disable block cache).
* Tables, which are accessed in a more predictable sequential way, must have block cache enabled instead. 

## Memory usage and compression

* ROW-CACHE core caching library [Carrot Cache](https://www.github.com/carrotdata/carrot-cache) is between 2x and 6x more memory efficient than its direct competitors (Caffeine, EHCache)
  when compressioin is enabled. 
* It means that you will be able to keep 2-6x more data in a same amount of RAM (compared to a other caches with client-side compression enabled). Clear benefits. 
* Compression works fine even for small objects (10s - 100s of bytes). Please refer to this blog post for more information about how compression is implemented in `Carrot Cache`:
  [Memory Matters: Benchmarking Caching Servers with Membench](https://medium.com/carrotdata/memory-matters-benchmarking-caching-servers-with-membench-e6e3037aa201) (`Memcarrot` is powered by `Carrot Cache` as well)
* Our compression is not a simple server-side compression - it is a bit more trickier :)

## PERFORMANCE AND SCALABILITY (Some old numbers, new ones will be coming soon)

* GET (small rows < 100 bytes): 175K operations per sec per one Region Server (from cache).
* MULTI-GET (small rows < 100 bytes): > 1M records per second (network limited) per one Region Server.
* LATENCY:  99% < 1ms (for GETs) with 100K ops on a small (4 nodes) cluster.
* Vertical scalability: tested up to 240GB (the maximum available in Amazon EC2).
* Horizontal scalability: limited by HBase scalability. 


## LIMITATIONS

* Caches the whole rowkey:family data even if only subset is requested (not a big deal when rows are small).
* Not suitable for large rows (100s of KB and above).
* Invalidates cache entry on each mutation operation, which involves this entry (rowkey:family). 
  Each time rowkey:family is updated, the corresponding cache entry is deleted to maintain full consistency.
* Make sure that your access is read mostly. 
* Cache compression support is limited. Zstd codec - Linux x86 and Mac OSX x86. 
* Current version supports Hadoop 2.x only (it can be rebuild with 3.x dependency, but I have not tried it yet). 

## Known issues

* No special handling for security/access control yet.
* Bulk loading does not invalidate cache
* Region reassignment handling. Scenario: Region R1 is reassined to a server B and then back to its original server A.
  In this scenario row cache in server A may containg stale data for the region R1.

## Dependencies

* [Carrot Cache](https://www.github.com/carrotdata/carrot-cache). This is new open source caching library under Apache 2.0 license. Cache implementation can be made pluggable.
* [Sidecar](https://www.github.com/VladRodionov/sidecar). This is the Caching Hadoop-compatible file system which supports HDFS, S3a, all Azures, Google Cloud Storage, Open Shift,
  and a couple of Chinese Cloud storages. This dependency is experimantal and can be removed. Its purpose is to improve Read (and Write!!!) performance of HBase in a cloud environments.
  This is a replacement for file-based block caches, compared to HBase block cache, in memory metadata overhead is 10x lower than in Block Cache, plus there are some interesting features on a write path - `Sidecar`
  supports caching writes as well via introduction of a write caching file system (for example, HDFS is used not only for WALs but for caching most recent writes - memstore flushes etc). 
  Not sure if it is important, so this dependency can be removed.

## How to build

* Build and install [Carrot Cache](https://www.github.com/carrotdata/carrot-cache)
* Build and install  [Sidecar](https://www.github.com/VladRodionov/sidecar)
* Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` for a `hbase-row-cache`
