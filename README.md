# HBase Row Cache
HBase Row cache, powered by [Carrot Cache](https://github.com/carrotdata/carrot-cache)  and updated to HBase 2.x. This cache is impelemented as HBase co-processor and can be easily installed into any HBase cluster.
[Apache HBase](https://hbase.apache.org) is an open-source, distributed, versioned, column-oriented store modeled after Google' Bigtable: A Distributed Storage System for Structured Data by Chang et al [link](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//archive/bigtable-osdi06.pdf). Just as Bigtable leverages the distributed data storage provided by the Google File System, HBase provides Bigtable-like capabilities on top of [Apache Hadoop](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//archive/bigtable-osdi06.pdf). The official HBase still lacks one BigTable feature, namely - Scan Cache, which caches frequently requested key-value pairs. This project adds this functionality to Apache HBase.
